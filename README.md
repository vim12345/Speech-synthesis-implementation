# Speech-synthesis-implementation
# Description:
Speech synthesis (or text-to-speech) is the process of converting text into spoken words using a machine learning model. It's a crucial task in applications like virtual assistants, screen readers, and voice-based interaction systems. In this project, we'll implement a basic speech synthesis system using a pre-trained text-to-speech model (e.g., Tacotron or WaveGlow), which can generate human-like speech from text.

# ðŸ§ª Python Implementation (Speech Synthesis System):
We'll use the TTS library, which is an open-source text-to-speech synthesis tool built on Tacotron and WaveGlow models. This makes it easy to convert text to speech.

# âœ… What It Does:
* Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts a given text into speech using a pre-trained Tacotron2 model.

* Audio Output: The generated speech is saved as a WAV file.

* Play Audio: Optionally plays the generated speech on a supported system.

# Key features:
* Pre-trained models like Tacotron2 or FastSpeech are used to generate high-quality speech.

* The system allows you to convert any text into natural-sounding speech.

* The audio is saved as a WAV file that can be played back or used in applications.
